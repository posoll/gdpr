# TPB-Proxy-PHP-Script
A functional and Tweaked PHP script to Proxy ThePirateBay.se
======

The script is designed for apache2, as there is present the .htaccess
It can be adapted to work with nginx with the following rules:

adding them on the server block.
There are 2 versions of this script, the one with base64 encoded images on the frontpage, and the non encoded one.
The encoded one, gives more "loading speed" while the other is a traditional one.
